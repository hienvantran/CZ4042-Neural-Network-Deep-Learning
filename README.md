# CZ4042-Neural-Network-Deep-Learning

The assignment contains 2 parts:

- Part A: Classification problem: It aims at building neural networks to perform polarity detection
  from voice recordings, based on data in the National Speech Corpus, which is obtained from
  (https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/digital-services-lab/national-speech-corpus).
- Part B: Regression problem: A team of data scientists have previously developed a model to predict HDB prices and found a subset of factors that best explains them. In this assignment, we will investigate whether the change in LTV ratio has made any impact on model performance and their analysis. This assignment uses publicly available data on HDB flat prices in Singapore, obtained from
  data.gov.sg on 5th August 2021 and 19th August 2022.

Technical framework: Tensorflow, Keras.

The notebooks were run in Google Collab and the directory to data may be changed. The data is in Data folder with data_preprocess.ipynb to process audio data format to full.csv format. RFE.py is for Part B.
